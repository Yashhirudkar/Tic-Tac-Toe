# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean and responsive user interface with a 3x3 grid where two players can take turns marking X and O. The game includes functionality to detect a winner or a draw, and provides buttons to reset the game or start a new one.
